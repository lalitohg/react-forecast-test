# react-forecast-test
Code test on react with forecast app subject

## API

App uses [AccuWeather]([www.accuweather.com) free trial API wich allows only 5 days forecast requests.

## Usage

This is a standard create-react-app solution.

After getting a copy of the repo run: `npm i`.

To start the app in development mode run: `npm run start` and open a browser windows pointing to **http://localhost:3000/**

## Notes

- Because of free usage requeriments some attributions are present in the layout at visible places within the app
- For demonstration purposes this app makes use of external API resources directly with no sensitive data protection. This is not suitable for production.
- Due to API's restrictions, several requests to forecast data might turn into unauthorized responses.
